# Project_4-Wine-Quality
Classification project Anat Peled & Guy Kahana

Kaggle Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/anatpeled/multi-class-classification-for-wine-quality

The dataset was taken from Kaggle, but originally downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset refers to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

The goal of our project is to predict the wine quality using its features

This prediction may assist wine makers in the producing process
